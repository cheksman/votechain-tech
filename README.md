Technology is growing tremendously, still, we have to go to the voting booths to cast our vote, So can we make the use of recent technologies to cast our vote safely and within the comfort of our homes? The answer is Yes. We can use blockchain to implement the system. Blockchain is used to build secure and scalable distributed systems. Vote chain, a blockchain-based voting system can help in bringing transparency and security to our voting systems. Now let us understand the working of the system:

- After being authorized by the verifier and the registrar, the vote booth UI generates a ballot for the voter to cast their vote.
